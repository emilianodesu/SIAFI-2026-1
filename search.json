    "text": "1.3 End-to-End Machine Learning Project\nIn this section, you will work through an example project end to end, pretending to be a recently hired data scientist at a real estate company. The goal of this example is to illustrate the main steps of a machine learning project, not to learn everything about the real estate business. Here are the main steps we will go through:\n\nLook at the big picture: What is the business problem we are trying to solve? How can we measure success? What is the current solution?\nGet the data: Where does the data come from? How can we get it?\nExplore and visualize the data to gain insights: What is in the data? What are the main characteristics of the data? What are the relationships between different attributes?\nPrepare the data for machine learning algorithms: How can we clean the data? How can we transform the data into a format that is suitable for machine learning algorithms?\nSelect and train a model: What are the different types of machine learning algorithms? How can we select the best algorithm for our problem? How can we train the model?\nFine-tune the model: How can we improve the model’s performance? How can we select the best hyperparameters?\nPresent the solution: How can we communicate the results to stakeholders? How can we present the solution in a way that is easy to understand?\nLaunch, monitor, and maintain the system: How can we deploy the model in a production environment? How can we monitor the model’s performance over time? How can we update the model as new data becomes available?\n\n\n1.3.1 Working with Real Data\nWhen learning about machine learning, it is best to experiment with real-world data, not artificial datasets. Fortunately, there are thousands of open datasets to choose from, ranging across all sorts of domains. Here are a few places you can look to get data:\n\nPopular open data repositories:\n\nOpenML.org\nKaggle.com\nUCI Machine Learning Repository\nAmazon AWS Open Data Registry\nGoogle Dataset Search\nTensorFlow Datasets\nPyTorch Datasets\nScikit-learn Datasets\n\nMeta portals that list many datasets:\n\nDataPortals.org\nAwesome Public Datasets\n\nOther pages listing many popular data repositories:\n\nWikipedia: List of datasets for machine-learning research\nQuora.com\nThe datasets subreddit\n\n\nIn this example, we will use the California housing dataset, which contains information about various districts in California, including features such as median income, average house age, and average number of rooms. This dataset is available in the StatLib repository and is also included in the Scikit-learn library.\n\n\n\nCalifornia housing prices\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Look at the Big Picture\nOur first task is to use California census data to build a model of housing prices in the state. This model should learn from this data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.\nThe first question to ask is what exactly the business objective is. Building a model is probably not the end goal. How does the company expect to use and benefit from this model? Knowing the objective is important because it will determine how you frame the problem, which algorithms you will select, which performance measure you will use to evaluate your model, and how much effort you will spend tweaking it.\n\n1.3.2.1 Pipelines\nA sequence of data processing components is called a data pipeline. Pipelines are very common in machine learning systems, since there is a lot of data to manipulate and many data transformations to apply.\nComponents typically run asynchronously. Each component pulls in a large amount of data, processes it, and spits out the result in another data store. Then, some time later, the next component in the pipeline pulls in this data and spits out its own output. Each component is fairly self-contained: the interface between components is simply the data store. This makes the system simple to grasp (with the help of a data flow graph), and different teams can focus on different components. Moreover, if a component breaks down, the downstream components can often continue to run normally (at least for a while) by just using the last output from the broken component. This makes the architecture quite robust.\nOn the other hand, a broken component can go unnoticed for some time if proper monitoring is not implemented. The data gets stale and the overall system’s performance drops.\n\n\n\nMachine learning real estate pipeline\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2.2 Frame the Problem\nFirst, determine what kind of training supervision the model will need: is it a supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, self-supervised, or reinforcement learning task? And is it a classification task, a regression task, or something else? Should you use batch learning or online learning techniques? Before you read on, pause and try to answer these questions for yourself.\nThis is clearly a typical supervised learning task, since the model can be trained with labeled examples (each instance comes with the expected output, i.e., the district’s median housing price). It is a typical regression task, since the model will be asked to predict a value. More specifically, this is a multiple regression problem, since the system will use multiple features to make a prediction (the district’s population, the median income, etc.). It is also a univariate regression problem, since we are only trying to predict a single value for each district. If we were trying to predict multiple values per district, it would be a multivariate regression problem. Finally, there is no continuous flow of data coming into the system, there is no particular need to adjust changing data rapidly, and data is small enough to fit in memory, so plain batch learning should do just fine.\n\n\n1.3.2.3 Select a Performance Measure\nA typical performance measure for regression problems is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). It gives an idea of how much error the system typically makes in its predictions, with a higher weight given to large errors.\n\\[ RMSE(\\textbf{X}, h) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left( h(\\textbf{x}^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \\right) ^2} \\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(\\textbf{x}^{(i)}\\) is a vector of all the feature values of the \\(i^{th}\\) instance in the dataset \\(\\textbf{X}\\), and \\(y^{(i)}\\) is the corresponding target value or label (the median housing price in this case).\n\\(\\textbf{X}\\) is a matrix containing all the feature values (excluding labels) of all instances in the dataset. There is one row per instance, and the \\(i^{th}\\) row contains is equal to the transpose of the feature vector \\(\\textbf{x}^{(i)}\\).\n\\(m\\) is the number of instances in the dataset \\(\\textbf{X}\\)\n\\(h\\) is your system’s prediction function, also called hypothesis. When a system is given instance’s feature vector \\(\\textbf{x}^{(i)}\\), it outputs a predicted value \\(\\hat{y}^{(i)} = h(\\textbf{x}^{(i)})\\) for that instance.\n\nAlthough the RMSE is generally the preferred performance measure for regression tasks, in some contexts you may prefer to use another function. For example, if there are many outliers in the data, you may want to use the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) instead, since it is less sensitive to outliers.\n\\[ MAE(\\textbf{X}, h) = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} | h(\\textbf{x}^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} | \\]\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Get the Data\nIn typical environments your data would be available in a relational database or some other common data store, and spread across multiple tables/documents/files. To access it, you would first need to get your credentials and access authorizations⁠ and familiarize yourself with the data schema. In this project, however, things are much simpler: We are going to download a single compressed file, housing.tgz, which contains a comma-separated values (CSV) file called housing.csv with all the data\n\n\nCode\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport pandas as pd\nimport tarfile\nimport urllib.request\n\ndef load_housing_data():\n    tarball_path = Path(\"datasets/housing.tgz\")\n    if not tarball_path.is_file():\n        Path(\"datasets\").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n        url = \"https://github.com/ageron/data/raw/main/housing.tgz\"\n        urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, tarball_path)\n    with tarfile.open(tarball_path) as housing_tarball:\n            housing_tarball.extractall(path=\"datasets\", filter='data')\n    return pd.read_csv(Path(\"datasets/housing/housing.csv\"))\n\n\n\n1.3.3.1 Take a Quick Look at the Data Structure\n\n\nCode\nhousing = load_housing_data()\nhousing.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlongitude\nlatitude\nhousing_median_age\ntotal_rooms\ntotal_bedrooms\npopulation\nhouseholds\nmedian_income\nmedian_house_value\nocean_proximity\n\n\n\n\n0\n-122.23\n37.88\n41.0\n880.0\n129.0\n322.0\n126.0\n8.3252\n452600.0\nNEAR BAY\n\n\n1\n-122.22\n37.86\n21.0\n7099.0\n1106.0\n2401.0\n1138.0\n8.3014\n358500.0\nNEAR BAY\n\n\n2\n-122.24\n37.85\n52.0\n1467.0\n190.0\n496.0\n177.0\n7.2574\n352100.0\nNEAR BAY\n\n\n3\n-122.25\n37.85\n52.0\n1274.0\n235.0\n558.0\n219.0\n5.6431\n341300.0\nNEAR BAY\n\n\n4\n-122.25\n37.85\n52.0\n1627.0\n280.0\n565.0\n259.0\n3.8462\n342200.0\nNEAR BAY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe info() method is useful to get a quick description of the data, in particular the total number of rows, each attribute’s type, and the number of non-null val\n\n\nCode\nhousing.info()\n\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 20640 entries, 0 to 20639\nData columns (total 10 columns):\n #   Column              Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n---  ------              --------------  -----  \n 0   longitude           20640 non-null  float64\n 1   latitude            20640 non-null  float64\n 2   housing_median_age  20640 non-null  float64\n 3   total_rooms         20640 non-null  float64\n 4   total_bedrooms      20433 non-null  float64\n 5   population          20640 non-null  float64\n 6   households          20640 non-null  float64\n 7   median_income       20640 non-null  float64\n 8   median_house_value  20640 non-null  float64\n 9   ocean_proximity     20640 non-null  object \ndtypes: float64(9), object(1)\nmemory usage: 1.6+ MB\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhousing['ocean_proximity'].value_counts()\n\n\nocean_proximity\n&lt;1H OCEAN     9136\nINLAND        6551\nNEAR OCEAN    2658\nNEAR BAY      2290\nISLAND           5\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhousing.describe()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlongitude\nlatitude\nhousing_median_age\ntotal_rooms\ntotal_bedrooms\npopulation\nhouseholds\nmedian_income\nmedian_house_value\n\n\n\n\ncount\n20640.000000\n20640.000000\n20640.000000\n20640.000000\n20433.000000\n20640.000000\n20640.000000\n20640.000000\n20640.000000\n\n\nmean\n-119.569704\n35.631861\n28.639486\n2635.763081\n537.870553\n1425.476744\n499.539680\n3.870671\n206855.816909\n\n\nstd\n2.003532\n2.135952\n12.585558\n2181.615252\n421.385070\n1132.462122\n382.329753\n1.899822\n115395.615874\n\n\nmin\n-124.350000\n32.540000\n1.000000\n2.000000\n1.000000\n3.000000\n1.000000\n0.499900\n14999.000000\n\n\n25%\n-121.800000\n33.930000\n18.000000\n1447.750000\n296.000000\n787.000000\n280.000000\n2.563400\n119600.000000\n\n\n50%\n-118.490000\n34.260000\n29.000000\n2127.000000\n435.000000\n1166.000000\n409.000000\n3.534800\n179700.000000\n\n\n75%\n-118.010000\n37.710000\n37.000000\n3148.000000\n647.000000\n1725.000000\n605.000000\n4.743250\n264725.000000\n\n\nmax\n-114.310000\n41.950000\n52.000000\n39320.000000\n6445.000000\n35682.000000\n6082.000000\n15.000100\n500001.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe count, mean, min, and max rows are self-explanatory. Note that the null values are ignored (so, for example, the count of total_bedrooms is 20,433, not 20,640). The std row shows the standard deviation, which measures how dispersed the values are.⁠ The 25%, 50%, and 75% rows show the corresponding percentiles: a percentile indicates the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. For example, 25% of the districts have a housing_median_age lower than 18, while 50% are lower than 29 and 75% are lower than 37. These are often called the 25th percentile (or first quartile), the median, and the 75th percentile (or third quartile).\nAnother quick way to get a feel of the type of data you are dealing with is to plot a histogram for each numerical attribute. A histogram shows the number of instances (on the vertical axis) that have given a value range (on the horizontal axis). You can either plot this one attribute at a time, or you can call the hist() method on the entire DataFrame to plot a histogram for each numerical attribute. Here is the result:\n\n\nCode\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nhousing.hist(bins=50, figsize=(16, 8))\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at these histograms, you notice a few things:\n\nFirst, the median income attribute does not look like it is expressed in US dollars (USD). After checking with the team that collected the data, you are told that the data has been scaled and capped at 15 (actually, 15.0001) for higher median incomes, and at 0.5 (actually, 0.4999) for lower median incomes. The numbers represent roughly tens of thousands of dollars (e.g., 3 actually means about $30,000). Working with preprocessed attributes is common in machine learning, and it is not necessarily a problem, but you should try to understand how the data was computed.\nThe housing median age and the median house value were also capped. The latter may be a serious problem since it is your target attribute (your labels). Your machine learning algorithms may learn that prices never go beyond that limit. You need to check with your client team (the team that will use your system’s output) to see if this is a problem or not. If they tell you that they need precise predictions even beyond $500,000, then you have two options:\n\nCollect proper labels for the districts whose labels were capped.\nRemove those districts from the training set (and also from the test set, since your system should not be evaluated poorly if it predicts values beyond $500,000).\n\nThese attributes have very different scales. We will discuss this later in this chapter, when we explore feature scaling.\nFinally, many histograms are skewed right: they extend much farther to the right of the median than to the left. This may make it a bit harder for some machine learning algorithms to detect patterns in the data. Later, we’ll try to tranform these attributes to have a more symmetrical and bell-shaped distribution.\n\n\n\n1.3.3.2 Create a Test Set\nIt may seem strange to voluntarily set aside part of the data at this stage. After all, you have only taken a quick glance at the data, and surely you should learn a whole lot more about it before you decide what algorithms to use, right? This is true, but your brain is an amazing pattern detection system, which also means that it is highly prone to overfitting: if you look at the test set, you may stumble upon some seemingly interesting pattern in the test data that leads you to select a particular kind of machine learning model. When you estimate the generalization error using the test set, your estimate will be too optimistic, and you will launch a system that will not perform as well as expected. This is called data snooping bias.\nCreating a test set is theoretically simple; pick some instances randomly, typically 20% of the dataset (or less if your dataset is very large), and set them aside.\nScikit-Learn provides a few functions to split datasets into multiple subsets in various ways. The simplest function is train_test_split(). There is a random_state parameter that allows you to set the random generator seed. Second, you can pass it multiple datasets with an identical number of rows, and it will split them on the same indices (this is useful when you have a separate set of labels). Here is how to use it:\n\n\nCode\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\ntrain_set, test_set = train_test_split(housing, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n\nHowever, we are considering a purely random sampling method. This is generally fine if your dataset is large enough (especially relative to the number of attributes), but if it is not, you run the risk of introducing a significant sampling bias. When employees at a survey company decides to call 1,000 people to ask them a few questions, they don’t just pick 1,000 people randomly in a phone book. They try to ensure that these 1,000 people are representative of the whole population, with regard to the questions they want to ask. For example, the US population is 51.1% females and 48.9% males, so a well-conducted survey in the US would try to maintain this ratio in the sample: 511 females and 489 males (at least if it seems possible that the answers may vary across genders). This is called stratified sampling: the population is divided into homogeneous subgroups called strata, and the right number of instances are sampled from each stratum to guarantee that the test set is representative of the overall population. If the people running the survey used purely random sampling, there would be about a 10.7% chance of sampling a skewed test set with less than 48.5% female or more than 53.5% female participants. Either way, the survey results would likely be quite biased.\nSuppose you’ve chatted with some experts who told you that the median income is a very important attribute to predict median housing prices. You may want to ensure that the test set is representative of the various categories of incomes in the whole dataset. Since the median income is a continuous numerical attribute, you first need to create an income category attribute. Let’s look at the median income histogram more closely (back in Figure 2-8): most median income values are clustered around 1.5 to 6 (i.e., $15,000–$60,000), but some median incomes go far beyond 6. It is important to have a sufficient number of instances in your dataset for each stratum, or else the estimate of a stratum’s importance may be biased. This means that you should not have too many strata, and each stratum should be large enough. The following code uses the pd.cut() function to create an income category attribute with five categories (labeled from 1 to 5); category 1 ranges from 0 to 1.5 (i.e., less than $15,000), category 2 from 1.5 to 3, and so on:\n\n\nCode\nhousing['income_cat'] = pd.cut(housing['median_income'],\n                               bins=[0., 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6., float('inf')],\n                               labels=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\nhousing['income_cat'].value_counts().sort_index().plot.bar(rot=0, grid=True)\nplt.xlabel('Income Category')\nplt.ylabel('Number of Districts')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the train_test_split() function with the stratify parameter to perform stratified sampling based on the income category:\n\n\nCode\nstrat_train_set, strat_test_set = train_test_split(housing, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=housing['income_cat'])\n\nstrat_test_set['income_cat'].value_counts() / len(strat_test_set)\n\n\nincome_cat\n3    0.350533\n2    0.318798\n4    0.176357\n5    0.114341\n1    0.039971\nName: count, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# extra code – computes the data for proportions in the full dataset\n\ndef income_cat_proportions(data):\n    return data[\"income_cat\"].value_counts() / len(data)\n\ntrain_set, test_set = train_test_split(housing, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\ncompare_props = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"Overall %\": income_cat_proportions(housing),\n    \"Stratified %\": income_cat_proportions(strat_test_set),\n    \"Random %\": income_cat_proportions(test_set),\n}).sort_index()\ncompare_props.index.name = \"Income Category\"\ncompare_props[\"Strat.

Also, if the training set is very large, you may want to sample an exploration set, to make manipulations easy and fast during the exploration phase. In this case, the training set is quite small, so you can just work directly on the full set. Since we are going to modify the training set a lot during the exploration phase, it is a good idea to make a copy of it so that you can always go back to the original data if necessary:\n\n\nCode\nhousing = strat_train_set.copy()\n\n\n\n1.3.4.1 Visualizing Geographical Data\n\n\nCode\nhousing.plot(kind=\"scatter\", x=\"longitude\", y=\"latitude\", grid=True)\n# plt.savefig('im/1_2/bad_visualization.png')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhousing.plot(kind=\"scatter\", x=\"longitude\", y=\"latitude\", alpha=0.2, grid=True)\n# plt.savefig('im/1_2/better_visualization.png')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can clearly see the high-density areas, namely the Bay Area and around Los Angeles and San Diego, plus a long line of fairly high-density areas in the Central Valley (in particular, around Sacramento and Fresno).\n\n\nCode\nhousing.plot(kind=\"scatter\", x=\"longitude\", y=\"latitude\", grid=True,\n             s=housing[\"population\"] / 100, label=\"population\",\n             c=\"median_house_value\", cmap=\"jet\", colorbar=True,\n             legend=True, sharex=False, figsize=(10, 7))\n# plt.savefig(\"im/1_2/housing_prices_scatterplot.png\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis picture tells you that the housing prices are much related to the location (e.g. close to the ocean) and to the population density (the size of each circle is proportional to the district’s population). The ocean proximity attribute may be useful as well, although in Northern California the prices in coastal districts are not too high, so it’s not a simple rule.\n\n\n1.3.4.2 Look for Correlations\n\n\n\nCorrelation examples\n\n\nSince the dataset is not too large, you can easily compute the standard correlation coefficient (also called Pearson’s r) between every pair of attributes using the corr() method:\n\n\nCode\ncorr_matrix = housing.corr(numeric_only=True)\ncorr_matrix[\"median_house_value\"].sort_values(ascending=False)\n\n\nmedian_house_value    1.000000\nmedian_income         0.688380\ntotal_rooms           0.137455\nhousing_median_age    0.102175\nhouseholds            0.071426\ntotal_bedrooms        0.054635\npopulation           -0.020153\nlongitude            -0.050859\nlatitude             -0.139584\nName: median_house_value, dtype: float64\n\n\nAnother way to check for correlation between attributes is to use the Pandas scatter_matrix() function, which plots every numerical attribute against every other numerical attribute. We decide to focus on a few promising attributes (including the target attribute, median_house_value):\n\n\nCode\nfrom pandas.plotting import scatter_matrix\n\nattributes = [\"median_house_value\", \"median_income\", \"total_rooms\",\n              \"housing_median_age\"]\nscatter_matrix(housing[attributes], figsize=(12, 8))\n# plt.savefig(\"im/1_2/scatter_matrix_plot.png\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhousing.plot(kind=\"scatter\", x=\"median_income\", y=\"median_house_value\",\n             alpha=0.1, grid=True)\n# plt.savefig(\"im/1_2/income_vs_house_value_scatterplot.png\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot reveals a few things. First, correlation is indeed quite strong; you can clearly see the upward trend, and the points are not too dispersed. Second, the price cap you noticed earlier is clearly visible as a horizontal line around $500,000. But the plot also reveals other less obvious straight lines: a horizontal line around $450,000,another around $350,000, perhaps aone around $280,000, and a few vertical lines as well. You may want to try removing the corresponding districts to prevent your algorithms from learning these quirks.\n\n\n1.3.4.3 Experiment with Attribute Combinations\nOne last thing you may want to do before preparing the data for machine learning algorithms is to try out various attribute combinations. For example, the total number of rooms in a district is not very useful if you don’t know how many households there are. What you really want is the number of rooms per household. Similarly, the total number of bedrooms by itself is not very useful: you probably want to compare it to the number of rooms. And the population per household also seems like an interesting attribute combination to look at. You create these new attributes as follows:\n\n\nCode\nhousing[\"rooms_per_house\"] = housing[\"total_rooms\"] / housing[\"households\"]\nhousing[\"bedrooms_ratio\"] = housing[\"total_bedrooms\"] / housing[\"total_rooms\"]\nhousing[\"people_per_house\"] = housing[\"population\"] / housing[\"households\"]\n\n\nThen we can look at the correlation matrix again to see how these new attributes compare to the others:\n\n\nCode\ncorr_matrix = housing.corr(numeric_only=True)\ncorr_matrix[\"median_house_value\"].sort_values(ascending=False)\n\n\nmedian_house_value    1.000000\nmedian_income         0.688380\nrooms_per_house       0.143663\ntotal_rooms           0.137455\nhousing_median_age    0.102175\nhouseholds            0.071426\ntotal_bedrooms        0.054635\npopulation           -0.020153\npeople_per_house     -0.038224\nlongitude            -0.050859\nlatitude             -0.139584\nbedrooms_ratio       -0.256397\nName: median_house_value, dtype: float64\n\n\nThe new bedrooms_ratio attribute is much more correlated with the median house value than the total number of rooms or bedrooms. It’s a strong negative correlation, so it looks like houses with a lower bedroom/room ratio tend to be more expensive. The number of rooms per household is also more informative than the total number of rooms in a district -obviously the larger the houses, the more expensive they are.\nThis round of exploration does not have to be absolutely thorough; the point is to start off on the right foot and quickly gain insights that will help you get a first reasonably good prototype. But this is an iterative process: once you get a prototype up and running, you can analyze its output to gain more insights and come back to this exploration step.\n\n\n\n1.3.5 Prepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms\n\nReferences:\nDisclaimer: Some of the material in this notebook is adapted from other sources.

    "text": "1.1 Basic Concepts and Definitions\n\n1.1.1 What is Data Science?\nThere’s a common joke that a data scientist is someone who knows more statistics than a computer scientist and more computer science than a statistician. (Whether or not it’s funny is up for debate.) Like all good jokes, though, it contains a kernel of truth. Some data scientists resemble statisticians who happen to code, while others look more like software engineers who dabble in analytics. Some are cutting-edge machine learning experts, while others focus primarily on business reporting or experimentation. There are PhDs with lengthy publication lists, and there are practitioners who have never opened an academic paper. In short, “data science” is notoriously hard to pin down, because almost any definition risks excluding someone who legitimately practices it.\nStill, the attempt at definition is worthwhile. At its core, we can say that data science is about extracting insight from messy, real-world data. The people who do this go by many titles—data scientist, data analyst, machine learning engineer, statistician, or business intelligence analyst. Even software engineers, researchers, and domain experts frequently find themselves doing the work of data science, whether or not it appears in their job description.\n\n\n\nVenn diagram showing overlap of skills in Data Science\n\n\nThe first diagram helps explain why data science is so difficult to define. It shows that data science sits at the intersection of computer science, mathematics & statistics, and domain knowledge. A successful data scientist combines all three: they need programming and software skills to manipulate data at scale, statistical and mathematical understanding to interpret results rigorously, and domain expertise to make those results meaningful in context. Add in machine learning, and you see how easily the field overlaps with multiple other disciplines.\n\n\n\nVenn diagram showing overlap of skills in Data Roles\n\n\nThe second diagram adds further clarity by mapping how different data-related roles emphasize different skill sets. Software engineers lean toward programming and system design, while data engineers focus on databases, pipelines, and scalable architectures. Data analysts center on reporting, visualization, and business understanding. Data scientists, meanwhile, sit in the overlap: they must balance coding ability, mathematical rigor, and communication skills to bridge technical work with actionable insight.\nThis overlap also underscores another key truth: data science is collaborative by nature. No one person masters the full breadth of skills in both diagrams. Data scientists usually work closely with engineers, analysts, domain experts, and business stakeholders. Technical proficiency alone is not enough—effective communication, critical thinking, and teamwork are equally essential to transform raw data into decisions that matter.\nIn this sense, data science is best seen not as a rigid job title, but as a mode of problem-solving that blends disciplines. The diversity of backgrounds among practitioners isn’t a weakness—it’s the very thing that makes the field so dynamic and impactful.\n\n\n1.1.1 Methodology of Data Science\nThe data science process is an iterative and interdisciplinary workflow that transforms raw data into actionable knowledge. While the exact steps may vary depending on the project, industry, or team, the process generally includes the following key stages:\n\nProblem Definition: The process begins with a clear understanding of the problem to be solved or the question to be answered. This step often requires close collaboration with domain experts and stakeholders to ensure the problem is framed in a way that is both meaningful and solvable with data. A poorly defined problem can derail the entire process, making this stage critical.\nData Collection: Relevant data must then be gathered from diverse sources, which may include relational databases, APIs, web scraping, sensors, surveys, or third-party datasets. At this stage, considerations such as data accessibility, privacy, and quality play a major role in determining the project’s feasibility.\nData Cleaning and Preprocessing: Raw data is rarely analysis-ready. This step involves addressing missing values, correcting inconsistencies, removing duplicates, and transforming variables into usable formats. Depending on the project, preprocessing may also involve scaling, normalization, text parsing, or image transformation. High-quality preprocessing is essential, since poor data hygiene undermines all subsequent stages.\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Before formal modeling, data scientists perform EDA to uncover structure, detect anomalies, visualize distributions, and generate initial hypotheses. This step combines statistical methods, visualization tools, and domain knowledge to shape an intuitive understanding of the dataset and guide later decisions about modeling.\nFeature Engineering: Raw data rarely contains all the information needed for predictive modeling. Data scientists therefore create new variables or transform existing ones to capture relevant patterns. Examples include aggregating time-series signals, encoding categorical variables, or constructing interaction terms. Good feature engineering often determines whether a model succeeds or fails.\nModel Selection and Training: With features prepared, data scientists select suitable algorithms based on the problem type (classification, regression, clustering, etc.), the data structure, and performance trade-offs. The chosen models are then trained on the dataset, often using cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.\nModel Evaluation: Trained models must be rigorously evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, or mean squared error, depending on the task. Evaluation also includes robustness testing, fairness assessments, and comparisons with baseline methods to ensure the model adds genuine value.\nModel Deployment: Once validated, the model is deployed into a production environment where it can generate predictions on new, unseen data. Deployment may involve integrating the model into applications, dashboards, or automated decision systems, often requiring collaboration with software engineers and DevOps teams.\nMonitoring and Maintenance: The data science process does not end with deployment. Models degrade over time due to changing data distributions, user behavior, or external factors—a phenomenon known as data drift. Continuous monitoring, retraining, and updating ensure the model remains reliable and relevant.\n\nThis cycle is iterative rather than strictly linear. Insights from later stages (such as poor model performance) often lead to revisiting earlier steps (such as redefining features or collecting additional data). Just as the diagrams showed, successful data science requires more than technical execution: it depends on problem framing, communication, domain expertise, and collaboration across multiple roles."

    "text": "1.2 Fundamentals for Data Scientists\n\n1.2.1 Visualizing Data\nA fundamental part of the data scientist’s toolkit is data visualization. Although it is very easy to create visualizations, it’s much harder to produce good ones. There are two primary uses for data visualization:\n\nTo explore the data and find patterns, trends, and anomalies.\nTo communicate results to others.\n\nA wide variety of tools exist for visualizing data. We will be using matplotlib, which is a popular Python library for creating visualizations. It provides a wide range of tools and functions to create various types of plots and charts. To install Matplotlib, you can use pip, the Python package manager. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:\npip install matplotlib\nWe will be using the matplotlib.pyplot module. In it’s simplest use, pyplot maintains an internal state in which you build up a visualization step by step. Once you’re done, you can save it with savefig or display it with show. For example, making simple plots is pretty simple:\n\n\nCode\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nyears = [1950,  1960,  1970,  1980,  1990,  2000,  2010]\ngdp = [300.2,  543.3,  1075.9,  2862.5,  5979.6,  10289.7,  14958.3]\n\n# create a line chart, years on x-axis, gdp on y-axis\nplt.plot(years,  gdp,  color='green',  marker='o',  linestyle='solid')\n\n# add a title\nplt.title(\"Nominal GDP\")\n\n# add a label to the y-axis\nplt.ylabel(\"Billions of $\")\n\n# save the plot as a PNG file\n# plt.savefig('im/viz_gdp.png')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking plots that look publication-quality good is more complicated. There are many ways you can customize your charts with, for example, axis labels, line styles, and point markers. Rather than attempt a comprehensive treatment of these options, we’ll just use (and call attention to) some of them in our examples. Although we won’t be using much of this functionality, matplotlib is capable of producing complicated plots within plots, sophisticated formatting, and interactive visualizations. Check out the matplotlib documentation if you want to go deeper.\n\nBar Charts\nA bar chart is a good choice when you want to show how some quantity varies among some discrete set of items. For instance, the next figure shows how many Academy Awards were won by each of a variety of movies:\n\n\nCode\nmovies = [\"Annie Hall\", \"Ben-Hur\", \"Casablanca\", \"Gandhi\", \"West Side Story\"]\nnum_oscars = [5, 11, 3, 8, 10]\n\n# plot bars with left x-coordinates [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], heights [num_oscars]\nplt.bar(range(len(movies)), num_oscars)\n\nplt.title(\"My Favorite Movies\")     # add a title\nplt.ylabel(\"# of Academy Awards\")   # label the y-axis\n\n# label x-axis with movie names at bar centers\nplt.xticks(range(len(movies)), movies)\n\n# save the plot as a PNG file\n# plt.savefig('im/viz_movies.png')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA bar chart can also be a good choice for plotting histograms of bucketed numeric values, as in the next figure , in order to visually explore how the values are distributed:\n\n\nCode\nfrom collections import Counter\ngrades = [83, 95, 91, 87, 70, 0, 85, 82, 100, 67, 73, 77, 0]\n\n# Bucket grades by decile, but put 100 in with the 90s\nhistogram = Counter(min(grade // 10 * 10, 90) for grade in grades)\n\nplt.bar([x + 5 for x in histogram.keys()],  # Shift bars right by 5\n        list(histogram.values()),           # Give each bar its correct height\n        10,                                 # Give each bar a width of 8\n        edgecolor=(0, 0, 0))                # Black edges for each bar\n\nplt.axis((-5, 105, 0, 5))                  # x-axis from -5 to 105,\n                                           # y-axis from 0 to 5\n\nplt.xticks([10 * i for i in range(11)])    # x-axis labels at 0, 10, ..., 100\nplt.xlabel(\"Decile\")\nplt.ylabel(\"# of Students\")\nplt.title(\"Distribution of Exam 1 Grades\")\n\n# save the plot as a PNG file\n# plt.savefig('im/viz_grades.png')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third argument to plt.bar specifies the bar width. Here we chose a width of 10, to fill the entire decile. We also shifted the bars right by 5, so that, for example, the “10” bar (which corresponds to the decile 10–20) would have its center at 15 and hence occupy the correct range. We also added a black edge to eacch bar to make them visually distinct.\nThe call to plt.axis indicates that we want the x-axis to range from –5 to 105 (just to leave a little space on the left and right), and that the y-axis should range from 0 to 5. And the call to plt.xticks puts x-axis labels at 0, 10, 20, …, 100. Be judicious when using plt.axis. When creating bar charts it is considered especially bad form for your y-axis not to start at 0, since this is an easy way to mislead people:\n\n\nCode\nmentions = [500, 505]\nyears = [2017, 2018]\n\nplt.bar(years, mentions, 0.8)\nplt.xticks(years)\nplt.ylabel(\"# of times I heard someone say 'data science'\")\n\n# if you don't do this, matplotlib will label the x-axis 0, 1\n# and then add a +2.013e3 off in the corner (bad matplotlib!)\nplt.ticklabel_format(useOffset=False)\n\n# misleading y-axis only shows the part above 500\nplt.axis((2016.5, 2018.5, 499, 506))\nplt.title(\"Look at the 'Huge' Increase!\")\n\n# save the plot as a PNG file\n# plt.savefig('im/viz_misleading_y_axis.png')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we use more sensible axes, and it looks far less impressive:\n\n\nCode\nplt.bar(years, mentions, 0.8)\nplt.xticks(years)\nplt.ylabel(\"# of times I heard someone say 'data science'\")\nplt.ticklabel_format(useOffset=False)\n\nplt.axis((2016.5, 2018.5, 0, 550))\nplt.title(\"Not So Huge Anymore\")\n\n# save the plot as a PNG file\n# plt.savefig('im/viz_non_misleading_y_axis.png')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine Charts\nAs we saw already, we can make line charts using plt.plot. These are a good choice for showing trends:\n\n\nCode\nvariance = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256]\nbias_squared = [256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]\ntotal_error = [x + y for x, y in zip(variance, bias_squared)]\nxs = [i for i, _ in enumerate(variance)]\n\n# We can make multiple calls to plt.plot\n# to show multiple series on the same chart\nplt.plot(xs, variance,     'g-',  label='variance')    # green solid line\nplt.plot(xs, bias_squared, 'r-.', label='bias^2')      # red dot-dashed line\nplt.plot(xs, total_error,  'b:',  label='total error')  # blue dotted line\n\n# Because we've assigned labels to each series,\n# we can get a legend for free (loc=9 means \"top center\")\nplt.legend(loc=9)\nplt.xlabel(\"model complexity\")\nplt.xticks([])\nplt.title(\"The Bias-Variance Tradeoff\")\n\n# save the plot as a PNG file\n# plt.savefig('im/viz_line_chart.png')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScatterplots\nA scatterplot is the right choice for visualizing the relationship between two paired sets of data. For example, the next visualization illustrates the relationship between the number of friends your users have and the number of minutes they spend on the site every day:\n\n\nCode\nfriends = [ 70,  65,  72,  63,  71,  64,  60,  64,  67]\nminutes = [175, 170, 205, 120, 220, 130, 105, 145, 190]\nlabels =  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i']\n\nplt.scatter(friends, minutes)\n\n# label each point\nfor label, friend_count, minute_count in zip(labels, friends, minutes):\n    plt.annotate(label,\n        xy=(friend_count, minute_count), # Put the label with its point\n        xytext=(5, -5),                  # but slightly offset\n        textcoords='offset points')\n\nplt.title(\"Daily Minutes vs. Number of Friends\")\nplt.xlabel(\"# of friends\")\nplt.ylabel(\"daily minutes spent on the site\")\n\n# save the plot as a PNG file\n# plt.savefig('im/viz_scatterplot.png')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re scattering comparable variables, you might get a misleading picture if you let matplotlib choose the scale.\n\n\nCode\ntest_1_grades = [ 99, 90, 85, 97, 80]\ntest_2_grades = [100, 85, 60, 90, 70]\n\nplt.scatter(test_1_grades, test_2_grades)\nplt.title(\"Axes Aren't Comparable\")\nplt.xlabel(\"test 1 grade\")\nplt.ylabel(\"test 2 grade\")\n\n# save the plot as a PNG file\n# plt.savefig('im/viz_scatterplot_axes_not_comparable.png')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we include a call to plt.axis(\"equal\"), the plot more accurately shows that most of the variation occurs on test 2.\n\n\nCode\ntest_1_grades = [99, 90, 85, 97, 80]\ntest_2_grades = [100, 85, 60, 90, 70]\n\nplt.scatter(test_1_grades, test_2_grades)\nplt.title(\"Axes Are Comparable\")\nplt.axis(\"equal\")\nplt.xlabel(\"test 1 grade\")\nplt.ylabel(\"test 2 grade\")\n\n# save the plot as a PNG file\n# plt.savefig('im/viz_scatterplot_axes_comparable.png')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Further Exploration\n\nMatplotlib Gallery will give you a good idea of the sorts of things you can do with matplotlib (and how to do them).\nSeaborn is a higher-level visualization library built on top of matplotlib that provides a more user-friendly interface and additional features for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.\nAltair is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python. It allows you to create complex visualizations with concise and expressive code.\nPlotly is another popular visualization library that allows for interactive and web-based visualizations. It provides a wide range of chart types and customization options.\nD3.js is a JavaScript library for creating interactive and dynamic visualizations on the web. While it is not a Python library, it is widely used for data visualization and can be integrated with Python using libraries like Bokeh or Dash.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Linear Algebra\n\nVectors\nA vector is a mathematical object that represents both magnitude (size) and direction. In data science, we think of vectors as ordered lists of numbers that can represent data points, features, or measurements. Geometrically, a vector can be visualized as an arrow pointing from the origin to a specific point in space.\nVectors are fundamental building blocks in linear algebra and essential for:\n\nStoring and manipulating data\nRepresenting features in machine learning\nPerforming mathematical operations on datasets\nComputing distances and similarities between data points\n\nA vector has countless practical applications. In physics, a vector is often thought of as a direction and magnitude. In math, it is a direction and scale on an XY plane, kind of like a movement. In computer science, it is an array of numbers storing data. The computer science context is the one we will become the most familiar with as data science professionals.\nMathematical Notation:\nWe represent vectors using lowercase letters with arrows: \\(\\vec{v}\\), \\(\\vec{w}\\), or in column form:\n\\[\\vec{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_n \\end{bmatrix}\\]\nTypes of Vectors\nRow Vector: Numbers arranged horizontally \\[\\vec{v} = [v_1, v_2, v_3, ..., v_n]\\]\nColumn Vector: Numbers arranged vertically \\[\\vec{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_n \\end{bmatrix}\\]\nUnit Vector: A vector with magnitude (length) equal to 1\nZero Vector: A vector where all components are zero \\[\\vec{0} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\]\nTo emphasize again, the purpose of the vector is to visually represent a piece of data. If you have a data record for the square footage of a house 18,000 square feet and its valuation $260,000, we could express that as a vector [18000, 2600000], stepping 18,000 steps in the horizontal direction and 260,000 steps in the vertical direction.\nWe can declare a vector mathematically like this:\n\\(\\vec{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 , 2 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\nWe can declare a vector using a simple Python collection, like a Python list:\n\n\nCode\nv = [3, 2]\nprint(v)\n\n\n[3, 2]\n\n\nHowever, when we start doing mathematical computations with vectors, especially when doing tasks like machine learning, we should probably use the numpy library as it is more efficient than plain Python. You can also use sympy to perform linear algebra operations; however, numpy is what you will likely use in practice so that is what we will mainly stick to.

Take scaling, for example. Let’s say we were trying to get the average house value and average square footage for an entire neighborhood. We would add the vectors together to combine their value and square footage respectively, giving us one giant vector containing both total value and total square footage. We then scale down the vector by dividing by the number of houses N , which really is multiplying by 1/ N . We now have a vector containing the average house value and average square footage.\n\n\nCode\n# Vector operations for data analysis\n\n# Sales data over 6 months\nsales_q1 = np.array([10000, 12000, 15000])  # Jan, Feb, Mar\nsales_q2 = np.array([18000, 20000, 22000])  # Apr, May, Jun\n\nprint(\"Sales Data:\")\nprint(f\"Q1 Sales: {sales_q1}\")\nprint(f\"Q2 Sales: {sales_q2}\")\n\n# Calculate quarterly growth\ngrowth = sales_q2 - sales_q1\nprint(f\"Monthly Growth: {growth}\")\n\n# Calculate growth percentage\ngrowth_percentage = (growth / sales_q1) * 100\nprint(f\"Growth Percentage: {growth_percentage}%\")\n\n# Total sales for each quarter\nq1_total = np.sum(sales_q1)\nq2_total = np.sum(sales_q2)\nprint(f\"\\nQ1 Total: ${q1_total:,}\")\nprint(f\"Q2 Total: ${q2_total:,}\")\n\n# Average monthly sales\nq1_avg = np.mean(sales_q1)\nq2_avg = np.mean(sales_q2)\nprint(f\"Q1 Average: ${q1_avg:,.0f}\")\nprint(f\"Q2 Average: ${q2_avg:,.0f}\")\n\n\nSales Data:\nQ1 Sales: [10000 12000 15000]\nQ2 Sales: [18000 20000 22000]\nMonthly Growth: [8000 8000 7000]\nGrowth Percentage: [80.         66.66666667 46.66666667]%\n\nQ1 Total: $37,000\nQ2 Total: $60,000\nQ1 Average: $12,333\nQ2 Average: $20,000\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrices\nA matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are fundamental structures in linear algebra and serve as powerful tools for representing and manipulating data in data science. Think of a matrix as a collection of vectors arranged side by side, or as a way to organize data in a tabular format.\nMathematically, we represent a matrix using capital letters like \\(A\\), \\(B\\), or \\(M\\). A matrix with \\(m\\) rows and \\(n\\) columns is called an \\(m \\times n\\) matrix:\n\\[A = \\begin{bmatrix}\na_{11} & a_{12} & \\cdots & a_{1n} \\\\\na_{21} & a_{22} & \\cdots & a_{2n} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\na_{m1} & a_{m2} & \\cdots & a_{mn}\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nFor example, a \\(2 \\times 3\\) matrix looks like:\n\\[A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4 & 5 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nIn data science, matrices are everywhere. A dataset with multiple features for multiple observations is essentially a matrix where each row represents an observation and each column represents a feature.\nTypes of Matrices\nSquare Matrix: A matrix where the number of rows equals the number of columns (\\(n \\times n\\)).\n\\[A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n7 & 8 & 9\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nIdentity Matrix: A special square matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere. It’s the matrix equivalent of the number 1 in multiplication.\n\\[I = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nZero Matrix: A matrix where all elements are zero.\n\\[O = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nDiagonal Matrix: A square matrix where all non-diagonal elements are zero.\n\\[D = \\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 5 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nLet’s see how to work with these matrices using NumPy:\n\n\nCode\n# Creating a basic matrix (2x3)\nA = np.array([[1, 2, 3],\n              [4, 5, 6]])\nprint(\"Matrix A:\")\nprint(A)\nprint(f\"Shape: {A.shape}\")\nprint(f\"Dimension: {A.ndim}\")\nprint(f\"Type: {type(A)}\")\n\n\nMatrix A:\n[[1 2 3]\n [4 5 6]]\nShape: (2, 3)\nDimension: 2\nType: &lt;class 'numpy.ndarray'&gt;\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Creating a square matrix (3x3)\nB = np.array([[1, 2, 3],\n              [4, 5, 6],\n              [7, 8, 9]])\nprint(\"Square Matrix B:\")\nprint(B)\nprint(f\"Shape: {B.shape}\")\n\n\nSquare Matrix B:\n[[1 2 3]\n [4 5 6]\n [7 8 9]]\nShape: (3, 3)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Creating an identity matrix\nI = np.eye(3)  # 3x3 identity matrix\nprint(\"Identity Matrix:\")\nprint(I)\n\n\nIdentity Matrix:\n[[1. 0. 0.]\n [0. 1. 0.]\n [0. 0. 1.]]\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Creating a zero matrix\nzeros = np.zeros((2, 4))  # 2x4 zero matrix\nprint(\"Zero Matrix:\")\nprint(zeros)\n\n\nZero Matrix:\n[[0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 0. 0. 0.]]\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Creating a diagonal matrix\ndiagonal_values = [3, 5, 2]\nD = np.diag(diagonal_values)\nprint(\"Diagonal Matrix:\")\nprint(D)\n\n\nDiagonal Matrix:\n[[3 0 0]\n [0 5 0]\n [0 0 2]]\n\n\nMatrix operations\n\n\nCode\n# Matrix addition (matrices must have the same dimensions)\nA1 = np.array([[1, 2], \n               [3, 4]])\nA2 = np.array([[5, 6], \n               [7, 8]])\n\nmatrix_sum = A1 + A2\nprint(\"Matrix Addition:\")\nprint(f\"A1 + A2 = \\n{matrix_sum}\")\n\n\nMatrix Addition:\nA1 + A2 = \n[[ 6  8]\n [10 12]]\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Scalar multiplication\nscalar = 3\nscaled_matrix = scalar * A1\nprint(\"Scalar Multiplication:\")\nprint(f\"3 * A1 = \\n{scaled_matrix}\")\n\n\nScalar Multiplication:\n3 * A1 = \n[[ 3  6]\n [ 9 12]]\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Matrix transpose (swap rows and columns)\noriginal = np.array([[1, 2, 3],\n                     [4, 5, 6]])\ntransposed = original.T  # or np.transpose(original)\nprint(\"Original Matrix:\")\nprint(original)\nprint(\"Transposed Matrix:\")\nprint(transposed)\n\n\nOriginal Matrix:\n[[1 2 3]\n [4 5 6]]\nTransposed Matrix:\n[[1 4]\n [2 5]\n [3 6]]\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Accessing matrix elements\nmatrix = np.array([[10, 20, 30],\n                   [40, 50, 60],\n                   [70, 80, 90]])\n\nprint(\"Full matrix:\")\nprint(matrix)\nprint(f\"Element at row 1, column 2: {matrix[1, 2]}\")  # Remember: 0-indexed\nprint(f\"First row: {matrix[0, :]}\")\nprint(f\"Second column: {matrix[:, 1]}\")\nprint(f\"Submatrix (first 2x2): \\n{matrix[:2, :2]}\")\n\n\nFull matrix:\n[[10 20 30]\n [40 50 60]\n [70 80 90]]\nElement at row 1, column 2: 60\nFirst row: [10 20 30]\nSecond column: [20 50 80]\nSubmatrix (first 2x2): \n[[10 20]\n [40 50]]\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Practical example: Student grades matrix\n# Rows represent students, columns represent subjects\ngrades = np.array([[85, 92, 78, 90],  # Student 1: Math, Science, English, History\n                   [79, 85, 88, 92],  # Student 2\n                   [92, 88, 85, 87],  # Student 3\n                   [88, 90, 92, 85]]) # Student 4\n\nsubjects = ['Math', 'Science', 'English', 'History']\nstudents = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana']\n\nprint(\"Student Grades Matrix:\")\nprint(grades)\nprint(f\"Shape: {grades.shape} (4 students, 4 subjects)\")\n\n# Calculate average grade per student\nstudent_averages = np.mean(grades, axis=1)  # axis=1 means across columns\nprint(\"\\nAverage grades per student:\")\nfor i, student in enumerate(students):\n    print(f\"{student}: {student_averages[i]:.2f}\")\n\n# Calculate average grade per subject\nsubject_averages = np.mean(grades, axis=0)  # axis=0 means across rows\nprint(\"\\nAverage grades per subject:\")\nfor i, subject in enumerate(subjects):\n    print(f\"{subject}: {subject_averages[i]:.2f}\")\n\n\nStudent Grades Matrix:\n[[85 92 78 90]\n [79 85 88 92]\n [92 88 85 87]\n [88 90 92 85]]\nShape: (4, 4) (4 students, 4 subjects)\n\nAverage grades per student:\nAlice: 86.25\nBob: 86.00\nCharlie: 88.00\nDiana: 88.75\n\nAverage grades per subject:\nMath: 86.00\nScience: 88.75\nEnglish: 85.75\nHistory: 88.50\n\n\n\n\nDeterminants\nA determinant is a scalar value that can be calculated from a square matrix. It provides important information about the matrix’s properties and has numerous applications in linear algebra, geometry, and data science. The determinant tells us whether a matrix is invertible, how it transforms areas and volumes, and is crucial for solving systems of linear equations.\nMathematical Notation:\nFor a square matrix \\(A\\), we denote its determinant as \\(\\det(A)\\) or \\(|A|\\).\nKey Properties of Determinants:\n\nOnly square matrices have determinants\nIf \\(\\det(A) = 0\\), the matrix is singular (non-invertible)\nIf \\(\\det(A) \\neq 0\\), the matrix is invertible\nThe determinant represents the scaling factor of the linear transformation\nFor a 2D matrix, it represents the area scaling factor; for 3D, the volume scaling factor\n\nGeometric Interpretation:\nThe absolute value of the determinant tells us how much the matrix scales areas (in 2D) or volumes (in 3D). A negative determinant indicates that the transformation reverses orientation.\nApplications in Data Science:\n\nChecking if a system of equations has a unique solution\nComputing matrix inverses\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA)\nMeasuring multicollinearity in regression analysis\nVolume calculations in high-dimensional spaces\n\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate determinant of a 2x2 matrix\nA_2x2 = np.array([[1, 2],\n                  [2, 5]])\n\ndet_A = np.linalg.det(A_2x2)\nprint(\"2x2 Matrix:\")\nprint(A_2x2)\nprint(f\"Determinant: {det_A}\")\n\n# Manual calculation for 2x2: ad - bc\nmanual_det = A_2x2[0,0] * A_2x2[1,1] - A_2x2[0,1] * A_2x2[1,0]\nprint(f\"Manual calculation: {manual_det}\")\n\n\n2x2 Matrix:\n[[1 2]\n [2 5]]\nDeterminant: 1.0\nManual calculation: 1\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate determinant of a 3x3 matrix\nA_3x3 = np.array([[1, 2, 3],\n                  [0, 1, 4],\n                  [5, 6, 0]])\n\ndet_A_3x3 = np.linalg.det(A_3x3)\nprint(\"3x3 Matrix:\")\nprint(A_3x3)\nprint(f\"Determinant: {det_A_3x3:.2f}\")\n\n\n3x3 Matrix:\n[[1 2 3]\n [0 1 4]\n [5 6 0]]\nDeterminant: 1.00\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Special matrices and their determinants\n\n# Identity matrix - determinant is always 1\nI = np.eye(3)\nprint(\"Identity Matrix:\")\nprint(I)\nprint(f\"Determinant: {np.linalg.det(I)}\")\n\n# Diagonal matrix - determinant is product of diagonal elements\nD = np.diag([4, 4, 2])\nprint(\"\\nDiagonal Matrix:\")\nprint(D)\nprint(f\"Determinant: {np.linalg.det(D)}\")\nprint(f\"Product of diagonal elements: {4 * 4 * 2}\")\n\n\nIdentity Matrix:\n[[1. 0. 0.]\n [0. 1. 0.]\n [0. 0. 1.]]\nDeterminant: 1.0\n\nDiagonal Matrix:\n[[4 0 0]\n [0 4 0]\n [0 0 2]]\nDeterminant: 32.0\nProduct of diagonal elements: 32\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Singular matrix (determinant = 0)\nsingular_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],\n                           [2, 4, 6],\n                           [1, 1, 1]])\n\ndet_singular = np.linalg.det(singular_matrix)\nprint(\"Singular Matrix (rows are linearly dependent):\")\nprint(singular_matrix)\nprint(f\"Determinant: {det_singular:.10f}\")  # Should be very close to 0\n\n# This matrix is not invertible\ntry:\n    inverse = np.linalg.inv(singular_matrix)\nexcept np.linalg.LinAlgError as e:\n    print(f\"Cannot invert: {e}\")\n\n\nSingular Matrix (rows are linearly dependent):\n[[1 2 3]\n [2 4 6]\n [1 1 1]]\nDeterminant: 0.0000000000\nCannot invert: Singular matrix\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Properties of determinants\n\nA = np.array([[2, 1],\n              [3, 4]])\n\nB = np.array([[1, 2],\n              [0, 3]])\n\nprint(\"Matrix A:\")\nprint(A)\nprint(f\"det(A) = {np.linalg.det(A)}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nMatrix B:\")\nprint(B)\nprint(f\"det(B) = {np.linalg.det(B)}\")\n\n# Property: det(AB) = det(A) * det(B)\nAB = A @ B\nprint(f\"\\nA @ B:\")\nprint(AB)\nprint(f\"det(AB) = {np.linalg.det(AB)}\")\nprint(f\"det(A) * det(B) = {np.linalg.det(A) * np.linalg.det(B)}\")\n\n# Property: det(A^T) = det(A)\nA_transpose = A.T\nprint(f\"\\ndet(A^T) = {np.linalg.det(A_transpose)}\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = {np.linalg.det(A)}\")\n\n\nMatrix A:\n[[2 1]\n [3 4]]\ndet(A) = 5.000000000000001\n\nMatrix B:\n[[1 2]\n [0 3]]\ndet(B) = 3.0000000000000004\n\nA @ B:\n[[ 2  7]\n [ 3 18]]\ndet(AB) = 15.0\ndet(A) * det(B) = 15.000000000000005\n\ndet(A^T) = 5.000000000000001\ndet(A) = 5.000000000000001\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Practical example: Checking system solvability\n\n# System of equations: \n# 2x + 3y = 7\n# 4x + 6y = 14\n\n# Coefficient matrix\ncoeff_matrix = np.array([[2, 3],\n                        [4, 6]])\n\n# Constants vector\nconstants = np.array([7, 14])\n\ndet_coeff = np.linalg.det(coeff_matrix)\nprint(\"Coefficient Matrix:\")\nprint(coeff_matrix)\nprint(f\"Determinant: {det_coeff}\")\n\nif abs(det_coeff) &lt; 1e-10:  # Close to zero\n    print(\"System has no unique solution (infinite solutions or no solution)\")\n    # Check if system is consistent\n    augmented = np.column_stack([coeff_matrix, constants])\n    rank_coeff = np.linalg.matrix_rank(coeff_matrix)\n    rank_augmented = np.linalg.matrix_rank(augmented)\n    \n    if rank_coeff == rank_augmented:\n        print(\"System has infinite solutions\")\n    else:\n        print(\"System has no solution\")\nelse:\n    print(\"System has a unique solution\")\n    solution = np.linalg.solve(coeff_matrix, constants)\n    print(f\"Solution: x = {solution[0]}, y = {solution[1]}\")\n\n\nCoefficient Matrix:\n[[2 3]\n [4 6]]\nDeterminant: 0.0\nSystem has no unique solution (infinite solutions or no solution)\nSystem has infinite solutions\n\n\n\n\nEigenvectors and Eigenvalues\nEigenvectors and eigenvalues are fundamental concepts in linear algebra that reveal the intrinsic properties of linear transformations. They are crucial for understanding how matrices act on vectors and have profound applications in data science, particularly in dimensionality reduction, principal component analysis (PCA), and machine learning.\nMathematical Definition:\nFor a square matrix \\(A\\), an eigenvector \\(\\vec{v}\\) is a non-zero vector that, when multiplied by \\(A\\), results in a scalar multiple of itself:\n\\[A\\vec{v} = \\lambda\\vec{v}\\]\nWhere: - \\(\\vec{v}\\) is the eigenvector (direction that doesn’t change) - \\(\\lambda\\) (lambda) is the eigenvalue (scaling factor) - \\(A\\) is the square matrix\nGeometric Interpretation:\nWhen a matrix transforms a vector, most vectors change both direction and magnitude. However, eigenvectors are special - they only change in magnitude (scaled by the eigenvalue) but maintain their direction. Think of it as finding the “natural” directions of a transformation.\nKey Properties:\n\nA matrix can have multiple eigenvector-eigenvalue pairs\nEigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal\nThe eigenvalues tell us how much the matrix stretches or shrinks in each eigenvector direction\nIf eigenvalue λ &gt; 1: stretching, if 0 &lt; λ &lt; 1: shrinking, if λ &lt; 0: reflection\n\nApplications in Data Science:\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA): Finding directions of maximum variance\nDimensionality Reduction: Identifying most important features\nGoogle PageRank: Ranking web pages using eigenvectors\nImage Compression: Using eigenfaces for face recognition\nStability Analysis: Determining system behavior in dynamic models\nSpectral Clustering: Graph-based clustering algorithms\n\n\n\nCode\n# Basic example: Finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors\nA = np.array([[3, 1],\n              [0, 2]])\n\n# Calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors\neigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(A)\n\nprint(\"Matrix A:\")\nprint(A)\nprint(f\"\\nEigenvalues: {eigenvalues}\")\nprint(f\"Eigenvectors:\\n{eigenvectors}\")\n\n# Verify the eigenvalue equation: Av = λv\nfor i in range(len(eigenvalues)):\n    v = eigenvectors[:, i]  # i-th eigenvector\n    lambda_val = eigenvalues[i]  # i-th eigenvalue\n    \n    Av = A @ v\n    lambda_v = lambda_val * v\n    \n    print(f\"\\nEigenvector {i+1}: {v}\")\n    print(f\"A * v = {Av}\")\n    print(f\"λ * v = {lambda_v}\")\n    print(f\"Are they equal? {np.allclose(Av, lambda_v)}\")\n\n\nMatrix A:\n[[3 1]\n [0 2]]\n\nEigenvalues: [3. 2.]\nEigenvectors:\n[[ 1.         -0.70710678]\n [ 0.          0.70710678]]\n\nEigenvector 1: [1. 0.]\nA * v = [3. 0.]\nλ * v = [3. 0.]\nAre they equal?
